1. Make sure you have python and venv installed on your device, if not - install it.

2. Open any folder, open console in it and run command "sudo python3 -m venv NameOfYourEnvironment", which will create virtual environment with name you put instead of NameOfYOurEnvironment.

3. Copy the django-drf-react-quickstart catalog into catalog with your environment.

4. Open console and go to /NameOfYourEnvironment/ and run "source bin/activate" to activate your environment

5. Copy requirements.txt to /NameOfYourEnvironment/ folder and run "pip install -r requirements.txt"

6. Open console and go to /NameOfYourEnvironment/ and run "source bin/activate" to activate your environment

7. In console go to django-drf-react-quickstart catalog and run "npm i webpack webpack-cli --save-dev" or "yarn add webpack webpack-cli --dev"

8. Run "pip install django djangorestframework" (if you don't have pip installed - install it)

9. Go to /project/ catalog and run "yarn build", then "python manage.py runserver".

10. That's it! You can open link from console and see the effect in your browser!
